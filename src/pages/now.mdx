I just finished my spring semester at CSULB last week. Already done with two years of university and turning 20 in October. I'll be extending my apartment lease till the end of December. I will be working fulltime at Bluon for this summer to save up as much money as I can. Also pretty excited for a change of environment. A lot of my goals/dreams I wanted to accomplish were achieved. I joined a dance team at my university and performed on stage. I made a ton of new friends. I traveled to China in January. I moved out to my own apartment. I learned to survive on a very tight budget, learned to cook, went on dates (with no success ;D), and started investing and saving towards my retirement. I completed another semester of university, started a second job working as an intern for a nonprofit organization in Long Beach, and learning to be comfortable on my own.

## Things I am starting to value more

**Seeking Change of Environment**

Having went abroad twice in the last 12 months, I saw how much I had matured and grown in those short weeks. And that is mainly due to putting myself in a very different environment and learning to adapt to it. In Japan, it was learning to stay at hostels, navigating the metro stations, and learning to be comfortable with feeling embarassed. In China, it was being a student diplomat, caring and supporting my friends, having crazy fun but more controlled, and seeing that there is more to the world than my suburban neighborhood.

**Being Alone With My Mind**

Have you had those incredible mental insights into your life when you were showering or washing dishes or doing some monotonous? That's what I attribute to feeling when I can be alone with my mind. I feel there are so many bogged up emotions, boiling thoughts, that I don't acknowledged because I don't allocate time to think anymore. And it is so relieving to be able to sit down and untangle all the knots

**Living a life true to myself**

From the book, The Top Five Regrets of The Dying, by Bronnie Ware, the number one regret was "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me". I know I can live a pretty safe and cushy life in USA with a career in tech. But what does it mean true to myself? I think for me, at least, is exploring a good chunk of the world while I am young, living with my morals and values, and being a creator and giver. A life true to myself is a life where I can be creative and build things that is empowering people I care about.

**Getting off my phone and music**

I am so distracted because of my phone. By getting away from it, even for a few hours, I can think a little about where I want to go in my future, what I want to do with my time, and reflect on my life. Otherwise, I just get so carried away that I don't even know myself anymore.
