I just finished my spring semester at CSULB. Already done with two years of university and turning 20 in October. I'll be extending my apartment lease till the end of December. I will be working fulltime at Bluon for this summer to save up as much money as I can. Also pretty excited for a change of environment. A lot of my goals/dreams I wanted to accomplish were achieved. I joined a dance team at my university and performed on stage. I made a ton of new friends. I traveled to China in January. I moved out to my own apartment. I learned to survive on a very tight budget, learned to cook, and started investing and saving towards my retirement. I also started a second job working as an intern for a nonprofit organization in Long Beach, and learning to be comfortable on my own.

## Learning

Practicing Japanese to a conversational level. Reading one book a month at least. Become a better cook and try to make different cuisines. Learning to be more grateful.

## Coding

Creating a sharable travel map app of where you been and where you been traveling in a asthetic way like LinkTree.

## Things I am caring more about

It's human to experience a range of emotions. Happy to sad. Clarity to confusion. Loved to lonely. And it goes the other way around. Thoughts are just thoughts. When I find myself feeling low, I am learning now that I am not taking care of myself well. If I take care of my lifestyle: sleeptime, sunshine, journaling, eating right, etc, I will eventually be good.

Another is just to kick myself out of my negative thought patterns.

## Music I been listening to on repeat this month
