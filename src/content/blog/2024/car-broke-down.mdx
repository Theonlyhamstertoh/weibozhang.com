Today I had the most humbling experience driving. I planned a night drive towards a scenic route but half way there, I realized my car was malfunctioning. While I was driving, it sounded like a tank was being fired off, metal sound was clinking against each other, and it felt like my car engine was about to break down on me. I quickly drove into a neighborhood, tried to find a good spot to park, but ended up at a deadend one-lane street. I stopped there to open the front trunk of my car to see what was the problem. Keep in mind, only just a few days ago, I got my brake pads and brake rotors changed. I tried reversing out of the deadend but realize my car wasn't moving. It was stuck. I tried to accelerate but my car just clunk clunk, like tanks firing off rounds, and moved nowhere.

I got really stressed out scared, I called my friend to calm down and then called my parents for rescue. During the time I waited, the dogs barked so loudly at me, the neighborhoods' cars just keep coming my way and everytime I had to go out and tell them my car just broke down and I couldn't reverse the car.

I was really nervous, in a completely strange neighborhood, stuck in the darkness, and in a one lane, deadend street. But it all changed when one of the neighbor came out and ask if I'm okay. God, am I immensely grateful for him, for I asked if I could later use his driveway to make a three point turn and drive out. He happily opened his gate for me and trusted my intentions.

When my lovely parents came, I cannot but just feel immensely grateful to have my Dad and Mom. Together, we pushed the car in neutral mode backwards. Another neighbor came out and helped us pushed the car. Then another neighbor. Then two more. In that moment, I realize how kind people are. There is so much fear and hate and racism going around that we forget we are all just people, with family, with problems, with the same worries and struggles. Generally, the majority of people don't go around intentionally to do ill. Everyone has fear for their safety but when you take that fear away, there is a community. A loving neighborhood. A caring neighbor.

It is definitely good to keep your safety in check, and tighter at night. But people are generally kind.
