						const body = "\nSince my trip to Japan, many of my friends and family pointed out the fact that I have changed. I feel that way too myself but it felt more like a gradual slow change over my time traveling.\n\nBefore, I used to be more socially anxious. Going out to places in public often give me anxious butterflies. I felt uncomfortable to be outside alone. I was shy and felt insecured about myself in public.\n\nNowadays, I know that I can talk to people. If I am lost or need help, I am thrilled to strike up a conversation. I no longer care as much as what others think about me. I used to seek to impress new people I met in hopes that they like me more, but now I'm okay. I don't need to impress anymore. It is not my \"task\" to worry if they like me or not. My task is to be myself.\n\nI also came to understand that **what felt important before was no longer as important as I thought.** Priorities change. I no longer felt the need to be “competing” with others. I want to do the things that mattered to me.\n\nI felt confident, curious, and happier in the process. I won’t always be happy but I felt I can be truly present when happy more often.\n\nI want to travel now because I want to keep growing and learning. I want to travel because it is exciting. I want to travel because I become a better me in the process.\n\n![Photo of Tokyo City](../../../static/images/blogs/japan-trip.jpg)\n";
